## NB: The first line to trigger will get the color.
##     If a cell belongs to two lines (e.g. CD3 and CD4)
##     and you want to prioritize one (CD4), then place it first.
##     This then is the way to specify a NOT (e.g. CD3+ NOT CD4+)
##     would be a cell that didn't get the CD4+ color, but then on later
##     line does get the CD3+ color.
